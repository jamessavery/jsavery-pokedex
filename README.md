# Pokédex Training App

Welcome to the **Android Pokédex Training App**!

Your task is to create a Pokédex application that consumes data from a public API that allows a user to browse through different Pokémon and look up their details. You will work together with your mentor to complete this project. Your mentor's job is to provide guidance and review your code.

An overview of the project, broken down into phases, can be found in the [Android Onboarding Project Instructions](https://konradgroup.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEV/pages/edit-v2/3628433563?draftShareId=cce4e49f-7503-454e-9739-73634d9e60e6).

You will notice that there is an **Issues** tab on the left side of the page when you navigate to this project in GitLab.

There are some tasks labeled as "Recommended" and "Optional" which you can do at any time. The **Board** view under the Issues tab is the best way to see your tasks and update their state as you work on and complete tasks.

**This project is open-ended.** Your mentor may add, remove, or modify tasks based on your interests, skill set, or project tech stack. Work with your mentor on prioritizing tasks.
